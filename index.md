## Bio

Mehwish Fatima is a third-year Ph.D. student in Computational Linguistics at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS), Germany, studying under Prof. Dr. Michael Strube. The working title of her thesis is "Single Document Cross-lingual Abstractive Summarization for Scientific Texts". <br><br>
Before coming to Germany, she worked as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Comsats University, Lahore Campus, Pakistan. In that period, she was actively involved in NLP research and co-supervision of different master's theses, in addition to her teaching duties. She also volunteered as a reviewer in "Natural Language Engineering" and "Information Processing & Management". Furthermore, she co-organized the "MAPonSMS'18" competition on digital text forensics in collaboration with FIRE'18.
